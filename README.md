# Portfolio Site

I created this portfolio so I could showcase the work I have been doing using ReactJS and the MERN stack.


## Installation

Navigate to the folder in your terminal and run

```bash
  npm install
```

Then run

```bash
  npm run dev
```

To get the project setup and running locally.
## Live site

If you'd prefer to view the project without installing and running it yourself, you can find the live site here
